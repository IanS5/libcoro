# libcoro

This C-library implements coroutines (cooperative multitasking) in a portable fashion.
This repository is forked from the CVS repo at http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libcoro.html.
The original README is provided below.

# README

Configuration, documentation etc. is provided in the coro.h file.  Please
note that the file conftest.c in this distribution is under the GPL. It is
not needed for proper operation of this library though, for that, coro.h
and coro.c suffice.
